# 📚 Grade Tracker

This is a small **Python command-line application** I built specifically for my **school** to keep track of my grades.  
It allows me to **enter new grades, calculate averages, and organize results by semester and module** — all stored in a simple CSV file.  

This project helped me to understand the work with data in CSV files.
